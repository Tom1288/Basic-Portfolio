			<h2>About
			</h2>

				<p class="about_me"> Hello! My name is Thomas Stevens. I am 28 years old. I was in the military for six years. I have been depoloyed to Afghanistan, where I served as a logistics specialist, participating in the largest retrograde cargo movement in U.S. history. After returning to the U.S., I began seeking a degree in financial accounting. While in the process of finishing my degree, I took a position as an A/P specialist/General Cashier for a Hotel. Over three years and two additional companies, a property management firm and a non-profit animal shelter, I moved my way through the accounting ranks to a staff accountant. After working as a staff accountant for about 8 months I realized that I did not love my job. Thus, I am now taking full stack web-development in order to accoumplish the task of doing what love for a living.
